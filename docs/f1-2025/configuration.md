# F1 2025 Data Collector - User Guide

## Overview

The F1 2025 Data Collector is a comprehensive telemetry collection system that captures real-time F1 game data and sends it to Splunk platforms for analysis and visualization. The system consists of a web-based control interface and background data collectors that capture UDP telemetry from F1 2025.

## Getting Started

### 1. Initial Configuration

**Configuation**

- **Rigs**: Choose the number of F1 rigs to monitor (1-4)
- **Event Name**: Enter a custom event name for dashboard identification

**Observability Cloud Settings:**

- Select your Splunk Observability Cloud realm (eu0, eu1, eu2, us0, us1, us2, au0, jp0, sg0)
- Enter your Access Token (this will be masked for security)
- Check "Enable Observability Cloud" to activate metric collection

**Splunk Enterprise Settings:**

- Enter your **HEC URL** and port (e.g., `https://your-splunk.com:8088`)
- Enter your **HEC Token** (this will be masked for security)
- Check **Enable Splunk Cloud** to activate event collection

**Playback Mode:**

- Select **False** for live F1 2025 events, **True** for demo/testing
- Click **Save Configuration** to apply your settings

### 2. Managing Data Collection

#### Master Control

Use the **Master Control** toggle to start/stop all data collectors simultaneously:

- **ON**: Starts collectors for all configured rigs
- **OFF**: Stops all running collectors

#### Individual Rig Status

Each rig displays comprehensive status information:

- **Rig Identifier**: Shows the rig hostname (e.g., RIG_1)
- **UDP Port**: Displays the listening port number with connection status
- **Collection Status**: Shows RUNNING (green) or STOPPED (red)
- **Container Memory Usage**: Displays current memory usage in MB
- **Race Complete Flag**: Indicates when a race has finished
- **Real-time Metrics**: When running, displays current speed, lap number, and track information

### 3. Player Management

#### Setting Player Names

Each rig has a player name field that can be updated:

- **Enter Player Name**: Type the driver's name in the text field
- **Update**: Click the "Update" button to save the change

!!! warning "Important Race Completion Rule"

    ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL**: Player names can only be updated when the UI displays **RACE COMPLETE** for that rig.

    - The system tracks race completion status automatically
    - When a race finishes (`FinalClassificationData` packet received), the rig shows **RACE COMPLETE**
    - Only then can you update the player name for the next driver
    - This prevents data corruption during active races

### 4. Monitoring System Health

#### Connection Status Indicators

The sidebar displays system health information:

- **Redis Badge**:
  - Green âœ“ = Redis database connected
  - Red âœ— = Redis connection failed

- **Collectors Status**:
  - Shows "X/Y collectors running" (X active out of Y total)
  - Green = All collectors running
  - Orange = Some or no collectors running

#### Real-time Data Verification

When collectors are running and receiving data:

- **Speed**: Current vehicle speed in mph
- **Current Lap**: Live lap counter
- **Track**: Current track name (e.g., "Silverstone", "Monaco")

### 5. Best Practices

#### Event Management

- Set meaningful Event Names for easy identification in Splunk dashboards
- Use consistent naming conventions across multiple events

#### Race Operations

- Always wait for "RACE COMPLETE" status before changing drivers
- Use the Master Control for coordinated start/stop of all collectors
- Monitor real-time metrics to verify data collection during races

#### Log Files

The system generates log files (`collector.log`) containing:

- Collector startup and shutdown events
- Data transmission statistics
- Error messages and debugging information
